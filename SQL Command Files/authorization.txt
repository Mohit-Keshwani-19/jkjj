We are working in a single user system. The user name is "system".

The following will give error, as there is no user1.

	grant select on emp4 to user1; 

grant select on emp4 to system;		-- This will work

You can specify the attributes for update or insert prviledge.

grant update (salary) on emp4 to system;
grant insert (salary) on emp4 to system;

What will happen to other attributes not mentioned in the grant insert? They will take the default value if specified
 or null value otherwise.

Attributes cannot be specified for select priviledge.

Delete priviledge allows deletion of tuples.

drop table emp5;
create table emp5 as (
			select * from emp4);

grant delete on emp5 to system;

delete from emp5 where empid=103;
revoke delete on emp5 from system; 		-- gives error as you cannot revoke your own priviledges

grant select on emp4 to system;	
revoke select on emp4 from system;
